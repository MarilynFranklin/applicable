<h1>Applicable</h1>
<h2>A Project for the Nashville Software School</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>As a member of the Nashville Software School inaugural class I was
looking for a way to give back to the school in some way. Applicable is
an attempt to enhance the school's application process to make it easier
for prospective students to put their best foot forward (and streamline
the process for the school). I hope that future NSS students can and will
also pick up this project and make it better for the next generation.
